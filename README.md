# GETTING THE APPLICATION

> Navigate to https://github.com/SyntaxError2015/krammy/releases and download  
the appropiate zip file for your operating system.


# USAGE

## Running the application

### Go into the downloaded folder and run the appropriate application as follows:

#### 1. WINDOWS
> krammy.exe


#### 2. LINUX
> krammy (may require to be set as executable, depending on the OS flavour)


#### 3. OS X
> krammy.app

# Functionality

The application consists of 3 panes:  
1. The leftmost pane is used for writing **kramdown** code.
2. The upper-right pane displays the generated html code.
3. The lower-right pane displays the rendered html code, as it would be displayed in a browser.

There are 2 available toolbars: one for interacting with the OS (also has keybindings 
for each action), and one for styling the kramdown code.
